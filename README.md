_The case study follows the six step data analysis process:_

###  ‚ùì [Ask](#1-ask)
### üíª [Understand](#2-understand)
### üõ†  [Process](#3-process)
### üìä [Analyze](#4-analyze)
### üìã [Share](#5-share)
### üö≤ [Act](#6-act)

## Scenario
Maven Fuzzy Factory is ready to secure its next round of funding and we are required to tell a compelling story to investors. I, as a data analyst in the team, is tasked to pull the relevant data, and help my CEO craft a story about a data-driven company that has been producing rapid growth.

## 1. Ask
üí° **BUSINESS TASK: Extract and analyse traffic and website performance data to craft a growth story that we could sell to potential investors.**

Primary stakeholders: Potential investors of Maven Fuzzy Factory

## 2. Understand
Data Source: A custom built database named mavenfuzzyfactory that closely resembles the databases found in e-commerce companies

Tables: 
  - order_item_refunds
  - order_items
  - orders
  - products
  - website_pageviews
  - website_sessions
    

The database contains 6 tables containing information such as users' website sessions, their orders, and their refunds. It is a big dataset that contains records of about 400,000 users. Also, it is comprehensive as it includes the actual time when they enter every webpages, utm trackers to track the performance of campaigns and contents, devices that the users use to enter the websites, as well as all the products that they have bought.



‚õî The dataset has limitations:

Since it is a custom built database, the data used is synthetic (data privacy is a concern)



## 3. Process

Examine the data:

```
head(bike_data)
dim(bike_data)
colnames(bike_data)
summary(bike_data)
```

Indentify unnecessary data and remove those columns:

```
bike_data <- bike_data %>% select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng))
```

Add two columns: ride length and day of the week:
```
bike_data <- bike_data %>% mutate(ride_length = ended_at - started_at) %>% mutate(day_of_week = weekdays(as.Date(bike_data$started_at)))

#Convert ride_length from from seconds into minutes
bike_data$ride_length <- as.numeric(bike_data$ride_length)
bike_data$ride_length <- as.numeric(bike_data$ride_length/60)
```

‚õî The started and ended time is in a yyyy-mm-dd hh-mm-ss format. We can further divide this into two columns: date and time. This step is optional.
```
bike_data <- separate(bike_data,"started_at",into=c('start_date','start_time'), sep=' ')
bike_data <- separate(bike_data,"ended_at",into=c('start_date','start_time'), sep=' ')
```

Remove data error:

```
#check for data with negative ride length:
bike_data <- bike_data[bike_data$ride_length>0,]

#check for data with ride length  more than 1 day (86400 seconds or 1440 mins):
sum(bike_data$ride_length > 1440)
```

Clean the data to prepare for analysis in 4. Analyze!

## 4. Analyze

1. Obtain overall session and order volumes for every quarter

```
SELECT
  YEAR(ws.created_at) AS yr,
  QUARTER(ws.created_at) AS qr,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS total_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders
FROM website_sessions ws
	LEFT JOIN 
    orders o
      ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

FROM 
(
SELECT
    pp.*,
    o.product_id AS cross_sell_product_id

## 6. Act
Conclusion based on our analysis:
- Casual riders rides mostly during the weekends.
- Casual riders ride longer duration, but least total trips. 
- Casual riders rides longer on docked bike, but least total trips.
- Most popular station for casual riders are: Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Millennium Park.
- Most active months for casual riders are from June to August.

Marketing recommendations to convert casual riders into members:

##### üö©  Marketing effort on the top 5 most popular stations for the causal riders. It can be a booth, print media on the bike or the locking station area, or social media post on contest starting from the most popular stations. 

##### ‚õ±  Promotional short term membership offer during the summer months.

##### üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Promotional weekend term membership for the weekends.

##### üéÅ Point-award incentive system for riding more trips in a membership format to receive discount and partnership offers.
